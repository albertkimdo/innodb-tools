Ho to use it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are two tools in this package:

* page_parser - to parse an innodb tablespace and save all pages splitted by table_id.
* records_parser - to take all files from splitted tablespace and retrieve records from them.
* heuristic_parser - to parse an innodb tablespace and find all records matching table definitons.

To recover innodb data you need to start page_parser with innodb tablespace file as a parameter.
As the result you'll get a directory with pages (pages-XXXXXXX).

Then you'll need to choose what table to parse and run records_parser with a table directory as a parameter.


Another option is to use heuristics_parser tool to get all records matching specified list of tables' records 
according to table_def.h file which could be generated with create_defs.pl script.

How to build it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compile mysql 4.1.X on your server. Then take libut.a file from innobase/ut/ and place it to current directory.
Then run make command and you'll get two binaries.

If you'd like to build static versions of binaries, uncomment CFLAGS line in the Makefile.
