Ho to use it?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are two tools in this package:

* page_parser - to parse am innodb tablespace and save all pages splitted by table_id.
* records_parser - to take all files from splitted tablespace and retrieve records from them.

To recover innodb data you need to start page_parser with innodb tablespace file as a parameter.
As the result you'll get a directory with pages (pages-XXXXXXX).

Then you'll need to choose what table to parse and run records_parser with a table directory as a parameter.


How to build it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compile mysql 5.0.45 on your server. Then take libut.a file from innobase/ut/ and place it to current directory.
Then run make command and you'll get two binaries.
