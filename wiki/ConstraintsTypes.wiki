#summary Types on constraints to set on table_defs.h

== Introduction ==

The constraints_parser application parses a tablespace file, eliminates invalid data, and produces a tab delimited file, ready for import using LOAD DATA INFILE. The step is described in [RecoveryStepsRecoveringTablespaceData Recovering tablespace data].

Constraints/limits are defined in the `include/table_def.h` file.

Following is a list of available constraints, per field type.

=== General ===

  * Any field can be set to nullable or non-nullable:
    `can_be_null: TRUE|FALSE`
  * Additional limits can be set with:
    `has_limits: TRUE`

=== Type: INT ===
  * INT allows for the following constraints:
    `int_min_val`
    `int_max_val`
    e.g.:
    `int_min_val: 1`
    `int_max_val: 12345`

=== Type: INT UNSIGNED ===
  * INT UNSIGNED allows for the following constraints:
    `uint_min_val`
    `uint_max_val`
    e.g.:
    `uint_min_val: 1`
    `uint_max_val: 65535`
