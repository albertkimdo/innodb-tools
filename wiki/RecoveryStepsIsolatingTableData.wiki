#summary Recovery steps: isolating table's tablespace data

=== Isolating the data ===

If you're using `innodbfile_per_table`, you can skip this step. Your data resides within the `.ibd` file. It is a tablespace of its own, and it is isolated.

Once we've identified the pages which contain our table's data, we wish to merge them into a single file.
Merging should be done by proper ordering. Back to our example:

{{{
[root@test innodb-recovery-0.3]# cd pages-1246363747/0-286/
[root@test 0-286]# ls -1 *.page | sort -n | xargs cat > /tmp/customer_data
[root@test 0-286]# cd -
}}}

The file `/tmp/customer_data` contains our data, and will provide input to the constraints parser. Users of `innodb_file_per_table` will use the `.ibd` file instead.

At this stage we are done with the first stage: getting your tablespace data.
