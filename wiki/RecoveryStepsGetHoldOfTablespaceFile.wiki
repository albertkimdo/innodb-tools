#summary Recovery steps: getting hold of your tablespace file(s)

== Getting a copy of your tablespace file ==

Waste no time. As soon as damage has been done, or as soon as you can react upon it, take a snapshot of your tablespace.

Exactly what _is_ your tablespace depends on your settings.
  * When using `innodb_file_per_table`, the answer is easy. It's the `.ibd` file.
  * When using shared tablespace, this may be the `ibdata` file; some prefer to split it. The may be more tablespace files. If you're not sure, you're looking for `ibdata1`.

=== Making the copy ===

The tools work offline the MySQL server. They work directly on the tablespace file. It is therefore important to have a quite file, to which no one writes. Best to copy it somehow aside. There are a few options for that:
  * Taking a snapshot (LVM; FS based; appliance based).
  * Setting `innodb_fast_shutdown`; taking MySQL down; copying the tablespace file(s).
  * Use Google Patches v2, `SET GLOBAL innodb_disallow_writes=1`, then copy tablespace file(s).
