#summary Recovery steps: Preparing the code for recovery

== Preparing the code ==

Recovery tools works in such way that the table schema is converted to a C structure. In fact, it is at current the user's responsibility to generate the header file.
In particular, the expected header file is `include/table_defs.h`

This is done with the `create_defs` script. Use:

{{{
[root@test innodb-recovery-0.3]# ./create_defs.pl --host=localhost --user=root --password=****** --db=sakila --table=customer > include/table_defs.h 
}}}
